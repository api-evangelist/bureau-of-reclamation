      Established in 1902, the Bureau of Reclamation is best known for the dams,
      powerplants, and canals it constructed in the 17 western states. These
      water projects led to homesteading and promoted the economic development
      of the West. Reclamation has constructed more than 600 dams and reservoirs
      including Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and Grand Coulee on the
      Columbia River.
