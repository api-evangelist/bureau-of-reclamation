      This API allows users to query RISE data programmatically and return a
      JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object. For Geospatial and File Upload
      datasets, only the metadata (the descriptive information about each
      dataset) can be queried from the API. For time series datasets, both the
      metadata and data can be queried.

description: >
  Established in 1902, the Bureau of Reclamation is best known for the dams,
  powerplants, and canals it constructed in the 17 western states. These water
  projects led to homesteading and promoted the economic development of the
  West. Reclamation has constructed more than 600 dams and reservoirs including
  Hoover Dam on the Colorado River and Grand Coulee on the Columbia River.
